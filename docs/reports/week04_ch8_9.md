# Report – Week 04: Performance & Regularization



**Presenters:** Ben Halima Ibrahim, Zoghlami Fadi 

**Date:** 10.11.2025 



## Summary

### Chapter 8: Measuring performance

**I - Training a simple model:**

A neural network with **sufficient capacity** will mostly perform well on the training dataset. However, this does not mean that it will generalize well on the testing dataset (which is normally new and unseen data for the model). This causes a big problem especially for real-world scenarios, where the model'performance has to be as good as possible in order to avoid crucial mistakes. <br>
==> Our goal is to train a model that **generalizes well on new data**

**II - Sources of error:**

**III - Reducing error:**

**IV - Hyperparameters:**

### Chapter 9: Regularization (TO DO !!)

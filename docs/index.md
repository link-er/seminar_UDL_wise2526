# Seminar "Understanding Deep Learning" (WS25/26)

This seminar is based on the open-access book [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) by Simon Prince.

Each week, one or more students will present a chapter or topic and document the results here. The goal is to create a collaborative, semester-long learning resource, including **presentation summaries, discussion notes, and reports**.
